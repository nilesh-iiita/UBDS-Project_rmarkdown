# U-BDS git repo template

## Description
This repository contains a general R markdown template to be used in tertiary analysis steps in addition to summary reports to be shared with labs we collaborate with. The style of the report here is also the same implemented in our U-BDS training website. Please ensure this style is always included in any reports delivered to the lab/PI.

Please check the current template for instructions linked to writing an R markdown report and also for an overview of the project structure. To get a better idea, please explore the other git repositories present within our group under the `Project` space.

Although the template contains general guidance on tertiary analysis, ensure you commit all secondary analysis scripts to the `secondary_analysis` directory. Any other scripts implemented in the analysis need to be committed!

Further, at a **minimun**, please update this `README` with the following information:

* Add link to Wrike project
* Add link to SOW if present
* Add information about secondary pipeline used, including version
* add information about reference genome/transcriptome file(s) including version and database
* Add link to U-BDS DockerHub containing image used in tertiary analysis
* Ensure you update the `README` with any other relevant information about the project

If there are any questions, ask Dr. Lara Ianov
